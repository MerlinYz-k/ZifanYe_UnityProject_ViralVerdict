  postTitle: If the world were to be unified into a single country one day, where
    would the capital most likely be located?
  postContent: "This topic first came to mind during my student days when my classmates
    and I were debating it in a school debate competition. We ended up arguing several
    times but couldn't reach a conclusion because it seemed like no location would
    be entirely appropriate. Some thought Istanbul might be a good choice, relatively
    speaking, but setting it there could lead to serious religious conflicts. Others
    even suggested that the capital might end up being on the moon. I\u2019m curious
    to hear what the community thinks about this.\nThis topic first came to mind
